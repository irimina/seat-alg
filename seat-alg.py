https://thepointsguy.com/news/airlines-purposely-splitting-up-families-make-more-money/

Step 2
Read the following code below and run it in the editor. You are to modify it in order to implement an algorithm ( of your own) to help with assigning seats to 
airline passangers. You want to take into account that families should seat together and so they should be allowed to get seats close to each other.

Step 3
Design/describe an algorithm in pseudo code that should be fair to seat allocation. 
Code the parts where it says "Modify this" and run the code to test if the seats are being alocatted the way you expect.

Questions to consider:
How will you seat passangers in the plane depending on the class ticket? ( randomly assigned, allow passanger to pick their tickets, etc)
How will you make sure that families can seat together? or at least two members of the family?

Python familiarity needed with 2D lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, (possibly) recursion.
